Linking OPEN AI to create granular prompts involves a multi-step approach, which includes trial and testing of different models and optimizing various features available on Open AI using the API. Once the linking process has been completed, we can input the tasks we want to perform on our dataset and generate corresponding code, which is then outputted into the designated file. We have successfully applied this approach to various datasets and achieved the desired results.

Generalizing the functions for web deployment using Streamlit: We have developed a local web application that enables users to deploy various datasets and select from a range of operations to perform on the data. These operations include normalization, encoding types, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and visual representations of selected models, among others. In the backend, we have streamlined and generalized every feature available in our Streamlit application.
