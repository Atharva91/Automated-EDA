# Automated-EDA-and-ML-Modelling

Project was Implemented using 2 different Approaches: -
Linking of OPEN AI to create Granular Prompts: - This approach Includes Trial and Testing of Different Models and optimizing different features available on Open AI to link it to our Working Space using the API. Once the linking Process has been done, we can use type out the things we want to perform on our Dataset and can output it into the write file where code related the same gets generated. We have effectively tried it on different datasets and have obtained the desired results.

Generalizing the functions to upload it on web using Stream lit: - We have created a local Web application where you can deploy any structured Dataset and can Select different operations you want to perform with the Data. It covers options such as Normalizing, Encoding Types, EDA, Model Building, Pictorial form of representation of selected model, etc. In the Backend we have used VS code and have generalized every feature that is available on our streamlit application.
